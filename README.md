# COVID-19 Model
A mechanistic population balance model to evaluate the impact of interventions on infectious disease outbreaks: Case for COVID-19
A deterministic population balance-based model is presented with a minimum but clinically and public health robust set of mechanistic and interpretable parameters and variables. The model aims at improving the understanding of the major phenomena involved and of the impacts in the systemâ€™s resources and needs of several possible interventions. The model level of complexity is targeted such that retains mechanistic meaning of all variables and parameters, captures the major phenomena at play and specifically allows for accessibility to non-experts and policy makers to comprehend the variables at play. I this way expert advice and decision making can be brought closer together to help guide interventions for immediate and longer-term needs.
